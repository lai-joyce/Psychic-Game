<!-- 
	Pseudocode:  
	Computer picks a letter from an array of letters.
	Player makes a guess by pressing a key.
	If player gets the guess wrong, decrease guesses left by 1, display the guess in the "Guesses So Far", and player guesses again.
	If player makes a correct guess, then increase wins by 1, and reset the game.
	If player gets the 8th guess wrong, then increase losses by 1, and reset the game. -->
